excerpt: 'Physical data are representations of the fundamental laws governing the Universe, hiding complex compositional structures often well captured by hierarchical graphs. Hyperbolic spaces are endowed with a non-Euclidean geometry that naturally embeds those structures. To leverage the benefits of non-Euclidean geometries in representing natural data we develop machine learning on PM spaces, Cartesian products of constant curvature Riemannian manifolds.'
